# Unicafe

This project is a solution for the "Unicafe" exercises in the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. It demonstrates the basics of React state management, event handling, and component composition by building a simple feedback application.

## Features

- Users can give feedback as "good", "neutral", or "bad"
- Displays statistics: total feedback, average score, and percentage of positive feedback
- Uses reusable components for buttons and statistics lines
- Shows a message when no feedback has been given
