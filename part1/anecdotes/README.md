# Anecdotes

This project is a solution for the "Anecdotes" exercises in the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. It demonstrates the use of React state, event handling, and array manipulation by building an application where users can view random programming anecdotes and vote for their favorites.

## Features

- Displays a random programming anecdote
- Users can vote for their favorite anecdote
